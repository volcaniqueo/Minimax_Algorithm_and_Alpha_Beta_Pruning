# Minimax_Algorithm_and_Alpha_Beta_Pruning
This project was my 2nd Homework for the course CMPE 480 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence) at Bogazici University.

## About the Project
This project is about implementing classical Minimax algorithm with and without alpha-beta pruning. The game is a modified version of the eight puzzle game. Please refer to the project description for the rules about the game and the input/output formatting.

## To Run the Code
One just need Python 3 to run the code. The program expects three arguments whose formats and meannings are explicity written in the project description.

So, simply run:

```python3 part1.py <selected_agent> <input_file> <output_file>```   (for the part 1)

```python3 part2.py <selected_agent> <input_file> <output_file>```   (for the part 2)
